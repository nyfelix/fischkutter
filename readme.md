# Remote Controlled Danish Fishing Boat

This is a project I did with my daughter and my good child. 
Most of the parts are 3D Printed or can be bought in any DYI store. In addition some RC and electronic components are needed.

A complete bill of materials will be published in this repository.

## Project State

At its current state, the project is ready to build a fully working remote controlled boat that can run forward and backward and steer left and right. 

However, the plan is to enhance the boat step by step to add new functionality. The ultimate goal however is that the children have fun and learn engineering skills.

# Next Steps

* Add a micro controller
* Add light that is switched on an off via RC
* Add a mechanism to lower and rise a net (e.g. to clean a swimming pool)
* Connect with mobile phone and access video stream
